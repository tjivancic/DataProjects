# DataProjects

This repository holds a few projects that I used to practice machine learning by applying it to hydrologic and weather data from the National Climate Data Center's Integrated Surface Data set, the USGS, and from a database established in 
Falcone et al. (2010)

Falcone, J.A., Carlisle, D.M., Wolock, D.M., and Meador, M.R. 2010. GAGES: A stream gage
    database for evaluating natural and altered flow conditions in the conterminous United
    States. Ecology 91:621
